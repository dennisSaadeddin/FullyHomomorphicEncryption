# FullyHomomorphicEncryption

The bottom line is that to be usable, information encrypted with traditional methods has to be visible in plain text at some point, if only for a brief moment. Another way to look at it is that a man-in-the-middle attack is always possible and as long as the attacker is creative when it comes to defining where the “middle” is!
Does it have to be that way? What if we could reliably manipulate encrypted information without ever decrypting it? Turns out that we can. Enter Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE). FHE is a class of ciphers that have the interesting quality that an arbitrary computation on ciphertexts generates an encrypted result which, when decrypted, matches what you would see had the same computations been performed on the plaintext. Sounds like black magic, doesn’t it? Theoretical FHE systems were postulated in the late 1970s. In the following decades, researchers implemented systems that permitted a limited number and limited types of computa- tions. Then in 2009, Craig Gentry described a system that could perform any computation, albeit very slowly. Basic computations would take hours! But it didn’t take long for Gentry and other researchers to come up with implementations many orders of magnitude faster. Those systems are finding practical uses today.
